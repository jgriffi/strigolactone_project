# Strigolactone project

This project will train a Random Forest regression model on data download from the [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) database for the HepG2 cell line. Strigolactones (SLs) a newly
discovered class of phytohormones, play a crucial role in the development of plant-root and shoot. Recently, many synthetic analogues of SLs have demonstrated
pro-apoptotic effects on different cancer cell lines like prostate, breast, colon and lung.  

## Data preparation  

Tutorials by [Chanin Nantasenamat](https://github.com/dataprofessor/code/blob/master/python/CDD_ML_Part_3_Acetylcholinesterase_Descriptor_Dataset_Preparation.ipynb) were especially helpfull in creating the Pubchem molecular descriptors using [PaDEL](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcc.21707). 

## Installation

The following packages are required:  
- pip install chembl-webresource-client
- pip install rdkit-pypi
