# Strigolactone project

This project will train a Random Forest regression model on data download from the [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) database for the HepG2 cell line. Strigolactones (SLs) a newly
discovered class of phytohormones, play a crucial role in the development of plant-root and shoot. Recently, many synthetic analogues of SLs have demonstrated
pro-apoptotic effects on different cancer cell lines like prostate, breast, colon and lung.
